# The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
An introduction to computer science course with particular emphasis on software and on machines from a programmer's point of view. This course concentrates on the ideas of abstraction, functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware.

## Projects
**Project 1: The Game of Hog**

In this project, students develop a simulator and multiple strategies for the dice game Hog utilizating a combination of control statements and higher-order functions.

**Project 2: CS 61A Autocorrected Typing Software**

In this project, students write a program that measures typing speed with typing autocorrect. 

**Project 3: Ants Vs. SomeBees**

In this project, students create a tower defense game called Ants Vs. SomeBees, inspired by PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies. This project uses an object-oriented programming paradigm. The project also involves understanding, extending, and testing a large program. 

**Project 4: Scheme Interpreter**

This project helps student develop an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language, with complexity in implementation decisions in interpreters and compilers. Students also implement some small programs in Scheme.
